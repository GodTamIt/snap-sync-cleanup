# snap-sync-cleanup

A simple Python script intended to occasionally clean up remote snapshots created by `snap-sync`.

## Code Style

For Python, the repository uses the default settings of the [**Black code formatter**](https://black.readthedocs.io/).

Conformance can be enforced by using `black` as follows:

```bash
black <file-name>
```
